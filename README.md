### Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For example, intracranial hemorrhages account for approximately 10% of strokes in the U.S., where stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death. Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient.
## Design an algorithm to detect acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes
##### Step1. In Linux with Python.
##### Step2. Download the source code of "case2.py" and the folder of "data", which involves training data and testing data.Moreover, the folder of "data" involves the dicom data transformed to the png picture.
##### Step3. Run the command to compile the script for the training data and testing data:
    python3 case1.py --training 1
##### Step4. Produce the file "testing_submission_trail3_CT_G11.xlsx" in which is the prediction result.
